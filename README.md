# A-simple-game

## Introduction 
This is a simple game that I created. The objective of this game is for the user to avoid the enemies and try and make contact with a jewel. The game loads a single character onto 
the left side of the screen then enemy characters appear from the right side, moving towards the character. The user must then use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the character
in order to avoid the enemies. The jewels move in the same direction as the enemies. If the enemy hits the character the game is lost. If the players hits the jewel the game is won.

## How to use this program
All you need to do is download an IDE that supports the Python language and then you should be able to run and test the code.

## Requirements
Please note that the Pygame module was used to create this game
